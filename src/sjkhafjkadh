Hey, I need a bunch of sentences checked. I'm an ESL student and I went to an English grammar challenge contest thing. I'm currently in the appeal phase, If I can find proof backing at least two of my answers I will pass. If not, I won't. I want to study English in college and that would be my pass. I hope you can help me, and thank you in advance.

Text in bold is what I need checked.

1st task, I have to fill in the sentence below so it has the same meaning as the sentence above. 

1. What time does the next boat leave?  
    Do you think you could tell me [b]when is the next boat leaving?[/b]
2. Does this train go to Gatwick Airport?  
    Can you tell me [b]if this train is going to Gatwick Airport?[/b]

2nd task, Fill in the sentence so it fits the context provided above.

1. You're sitting in the classroom on a hot day. You're daydreaming about going to the beach. You think:

2. You are walking towards the bus stop with a friend. Suddenly, the bus arrives. The bus stop is far away, but you think there is a chance of catching the bus. You say:
